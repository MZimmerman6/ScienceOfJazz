In 'Chasing Ice,' we follow Balog across the Arctic as he deploys revolutionary time-lapse cameras designed for one purpose: to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers. Balog's hauntingly beautiful videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. Traveling with a young team of adventurers by helicopter, canoe and dog sled across three continents, Balog risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story in human history.

When we think of mummies - often the first thing that comes to mind is Ancient Egypt \u2013 we envision monsters coming back to life to walk the earth once again. This lecture explores the world of preserved human remains, through time and across continents, a 5,000-year journey. There exists an amazing diversity of preserved human remains; some created deliberately, some naturally, on virtually all continents, in all time periods. Enhanced by high quality images of preserved human remains, the lecture takes us on a journey from this life to the afterlife by letting these past lives speak for themselves once again. This program is funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

This issue has been the subject of inquiry by the likes of philosophers, linguists, and even a medieval Pope who would isolate infants from birth to see what ancient biblical language they would speak in the absence of instruction. Discover how and when language emerged through the anatomy of our fossil ancestors, and discover how this relates to the archaeological record, our brains, and our genes.

Using the introductory programming language Scratch, all participants brainstormed, designed, and programmed their own unique video game illustrating fundamental concepts associated with science, mathematics, and engineering.  Presentations will include sample games, an overview of participant  game design sheets, and the process which the middle schoolers followed to create their games while learning the fundamental concepts characteristic of object-oriented computer programming.\r\n\r\n","teaser":null,"log":"","revision_timestamp":"1333724880","format":"1","name":"admin","picture":"","data":"a:1:{s:13:\"form_build_id\";s:37:\"form-2148042c9a493843fb5416a30b3d6cbe\";}","path":"events\/2012\/04\/neighborhood-science-afterschool-overbrook-park-branch-library","field_event_phone":[{"value":null}],"field_event_date":[{"value":"2012-04-26T19:00:00","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"date","formatted_date":"April 26 2012, 7:00 PM"}],"field_event_summary":[{"value":null}],"field_event_festival":[{"nid":"925"}],"field_event_website":[{"url":null,"title":null,"attributes":false}],"field_event_reservation_type":[{"value":"No Reservation Required"}],"field_reservation_url":[{"url":null,"title":null,"attributes":false}],"field_event_contact_name":[{"value":null}],"field_reservation_phone":[{"value":null}],"field_event_image":[{"fid":"2320","list":"1","data":{"alt":"","title":""},"uid":"1","filename":"neighborhood library.jpg","filepath":"sites\/philasciencefestival.org\/files\/neighborhood library_11.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"80537","status":"1","timestamp":"1333724879"}],"field_show_ticket_heading":[{"value":"0"}],"field_reservation_info":[{"value":null,"format":null}],"field_event_org":[{"nid":"92"}],"field_speakers":[{"nid":null}],"node_privacy_byrole":{"roles":{"1":{"view":1,"edit":0,"delete":0},"2":{"view":1,"edit":0,"delete":0},"3":{"view":0,"edit":0,"delete":0},"5":{"view":0,"edit":0,"delete":0}}},"last_comment_timestamp":"1331172308","last_comment_name":null,"comment_count":"0","taxonomy":{"29":{"tid":"29","vid":"5","name":"Adult","description":"","weight":"0"},"27":{"tid":"27","vid":"5","name":"Family\/Children","description":"","weight":"1"},"39":{"tid":"39","vid":"4","name":"Neighborhood Events","description":"","weight":"1"},"19":{"tid":"19","vid":"5","name":"High School","description":"","weight":"2"},"20":{"tid":"20","vid":"6","name":"University City\/West Philadelphia","description":"","weight":"10"}},"locations":[{"lid":"460","name":"Overbrook Park Branch Library","street":"7422 Haverford Avenue","additional":"","city":"Philadelphia","province":"PA","postal_code":"19151","country":"us","latitude":"39.976019","longitude":"-75.264070","source":"3","is_primary":"0","province_name":"Pennsylvania","country_name":"United States"}],"location":{"lid":"460","name":"Overbrook Park Branch Library","street":"7422 Haverford Avenue","additional":"","city":"Philadelphia","province":"PA","postal_code":"19151","country":"us","latitude":"39.976019","longitude":"-75.264070","source":"3","is_primary":"0","province_name":"Pennsylvania","country_name":"United States"}},{"nid":"1285","type":"event","language":"","uid":"1","status":"1","created":"1331171997","changed":"1333570099","comment":"2","promote":"0","moderate":"0","sticky":"0","tnid":"0","translate":"0","vid":"1286","revision_uid":"1","title":"Neighborhood Science Afterschool: Bustleton Branch Library","body":"From Chestnut Hill to Port Richmond, Kensington to Point Breeze, and everywhere in between, Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods.

A number of illustrations in this talk are images of actual ancient Egyptian mummies, many collected as part of the speaker's own research in Egypt.This program is funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.\r\nPresenter: Dr. Stephen Phillips \r\n\r\n4:20-5:00pm- Have to Have A Habitat\r\nA Riverbend naturalist will open up the natural world by exploring what everyone needs to survive.

The program will include live animals, hands-on activities and natural artifacts.\r\n\r\n5:00-6:00pm- Lichens- Lessons on Living Together: Begins with an interactive game in which participants look at lichen samples in a musical-chairs king of setting.  This is followed by a brief slide show and another interactive activity that involves simulation of the lichen symbiosis (two organisms living together) using fish nets to represent fungi and green balloons as algae.It then moves into a discussion of air pollution effects, with the information level  depending upon the audience. \r\n\r\n6:00-7:00pm- The Franklin Institute's Traveling Science Shows presents...\r\nHot and Cold!
