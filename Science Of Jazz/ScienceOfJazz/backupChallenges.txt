It looks like a walkway going around the building. What was it used for?","answer":"The dry moat surrounding the Hospital was used to exercise the mentally ill. Out of morbid curiosity, townspeople gathered on Sundays to watch the patients. Hospital leaders attempted to discourage this by building a fence in front of the windows to the cells. When this proved ineffective, a sign was put up stating that anyone intent on viewing the patients must pay 4 pence. The money was used to provide funding needed to care for more patients, both the physically ill and the insane.","qrurl":"https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=500x500&chl=%7B%22info%22%3A%7B%22points%22%3A%2210%22,%22lat%22%3A%2239.9517194%22,%22lon%22%3A%22-75.2029116%22,%22id%22%3A%22Penns100%22%7D%7D&choe=UTF-8&chld=H","info":"The east wing of the Pine Building was completed in 1755 and the first patients were admitted here in 1756.
